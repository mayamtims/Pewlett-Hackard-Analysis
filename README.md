# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per job title and identify employees who are qualified to join mentorship program post retirement.Two tables were created in SQL to present this informaiton. The first table of retiring employees per job title had employee number, first name, last name, birth date, start date, end date and position title columns. The second table of employees for the mentorship program's columns were employee number, first name, last name, birth date, start date, end date and position title. 

## Results
Both tables were exported as CSV files and can be found by clicking on the links below:

[mentorship_eligibility](https://github.com/mayamtims/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

There are four main points that can be deduced from the tables:
1. There are 90,398 employees who are eligible to retire soon.
2. The majority of the retirees are members of the senior staff, almost one third of them being senior engineers. When looking to hire new employees, hiring staff should look to bring on people who can fill senior engineer and other senior staff positions.
3. Of those retiring, 1,549 employees qualify for the mentorship program and the majority of them have senior titles.
4. There are far more people retiring, and therefore more open positions, than there are people eligibile for the mentorship program. The program needs to be either efficient enough for one retiree to be able to mentor multiple new hires, or it needs to be expanded.
